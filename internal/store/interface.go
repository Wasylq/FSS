	// passes only freshly-scraped scenes and expects everything else to

	// about it being gone". `--refresh` mode is what stamps `DeletedAt`
	// on scenes the scraper no longer sees; callers wanting to preserve
	// an existing soft-delete must include the existing scene (with its
	// `DeletedAt` intact) in the `scenes` slice.
