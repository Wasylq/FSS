// Canon rewrites the performer names a storefront publishes into the spelling
// its creator is filed under.
//
// Storefronts routinely credit their own branding as the performer: a shop
// trading as "<Name> Films" lists "<Name> Films" as the performer on every
// scene. Stored verbatim, one person becomes several performers, and every
// cross-store view
// — `fss compare`, a Stash import, and `suggest`'s own shared-performer signal
// — fragments along with them.
//
// A credit is branding when it matches either of two things, both already
// known without any extra configuration:
//
//   - the scene's own Studio value. A storefront that credits itself as the
//     performer says so in both fields at once, and on a creator's store the
//     storefront is the creator. This is the dominant case by a wide margin,
//     and it needs nothing written down.
//   - one of the creator's declared aliases. The escape hatch for the residue,
//     where a store spells its own name one way in the studio field and
//     another in the credit.
//
// Everything is scoped to the stores a creator file lists, which is what makes
// it safe: a co-star is never touched, however much their name resembles the
// creator's, because neither rule can fire on a name that is neither the shop
// nor a spelling of it.
//
// It deliberately holds no fuzzy matching. Deciding that an unfamiliar name is
// really this creator needs evidence a single scene does not carry — which
// storefronts credit it, and nothing else — so that judgement lives in
// `fss creators suggest`, which has the whole library to reason over and writes
// its conclusion to the file for review.
