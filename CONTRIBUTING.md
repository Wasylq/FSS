## Adding a New Scraper

Each site scraper is a self-contained package under `internal/scrapers/<site>/`. The system uses a plugin-based registry — no central config to edit beyond a one-line import.

### 1. Create the package

Create `internal/scrapers/<site>/<site>.go`. Your scraper must implement the `scraper.StudioScraper` interface:

```go
type StudioScraper interface {
    ID() string
    Patterns() []string
    MatchesURL(url string) bool
    ListScenes(ctx context.Context, studioURL string, opts ListOpts) (<-chan SceneResult, error)
}
```

- **`ID()`** — stable lowercase identifier, e.g. `"pornhub"`
- **`Patterns()`** — human-readable URL patterns shown by `fss list-scrapers`, e.g. `"pornhub.com/pornstar/{slug}"`
- **`MatchesURL()`** — returns true if this scraper handles the given URL (use a compiled regex)
- **`ListScenes()`** — starts a goroutine that sends results on a channel, returns the channel immediately

### 2. Register via init()

```go
func init() {
    scraper.Register(New())
}
```

This is called automatically at startup when the package is imported.

### 2a. Host regexes

`MatchesURL` decides which scraper claims a URL, and `scraper.ForURL` returns the
**first** match. A regex that anchors the start but not the end of the host is a
prefix match, so `^https?://(?:www\.)?example\.com` also claims
`https://example.com.evil.invalid/`. Because most scrapers fetch the studio URL
verbatim, that look-alike host's content would be scraped and stored under the
legitimate studio's key.

Terminate the host:

```go
regexp.MustCompile(`^https?://(?:www\.)?example\.com(?:/|$)`)
```

- `\b` is **not** a terminator — there is a word boundary between `com` and
  `.evil`, so the look-alike still matches.
- A regex that continues into a path (`example\.com/videos`) is already
  terminated by the `/`; adding another is wrong.
- In an alternation, each branch that ends at a host needs its own terminator:
  `(?:a\.com(?:/|$)|b\.com/tour/…)`.
- Don't match with `strings.Contains(u, "://"+domain)` — it accepts any host
  that merely contains the domain, and any URL with the domain in its query
  string. Use `scraper.HostMatches(u, domain)`, which compares parsed hosts and
  ignores a leading `www.` on either side.

`TestRegistryMatchesURLTerminatesTheHost` builds a look-alike from every
registered scraper's own advertised host and fails if it matches, so a new
scraper cannot reintroduce this.

### 3. Add blank import in main.go

```go
_ "github.com/Wasylq/FSS/internal/scrapers/<site>"
```

This triggers `init()` and registers the scraper. Without this line, the scraper won't be available.

### 4. Implement the run() goroutine

The `ListScenes` method launches a goroutine that sends `SceneResult` values on a channel. See `internal/scrapers/pornhub/pornhub.go` for the simplest complete example.

**Use `scraper.Paginate`** for page-numbered pagination — it handles delay, ctx cancellation, progress reporting, KnownIDs early-stop, and scene sending. Your callback just fetches and parses one page:

```go
func (s *Scraper) run(ctx context.Context, studioURL string, opts scraper.ListOpts, out chan<- scraper.SceneResult) {
    defer close(out) // MUST be the first line
    now := time.Now().UTC()

    scraper.Paginate(ctx, opts, "mysite", out, func(ctx context.Context, page int) (scraper.PageResult, error) {
        items, total, err := s.fetchPage(ctx, studioURL, page)
        if err != nil {
            return scraper.PageResult{}, err
        }
        scenes := make([]models.Scene, len(items))
        for i, item := range items {
            scenes[i] = toScene(item, studioURL, now)
        }
        return scraper.PageResult{
            Scenes: scenes,
            Total:  total,                    // set on first page for progress display
            Done:   len(items) == 0,          // or page >= totalPages
        }, nil
    })
}
```

For scrapers that can't use `Paginate` (worker pools, cursor-based pagination), use the manual loop pattern — every channel send must be wrapped in `select` with `case <-ctx.Done(): return` to prevent goroutine leaks. See `manyvids` or `kink` for examples.

**Critical rules:**

- `defer close(out)` must be the first line in `run()` — the consumer blocks on this channel
- `Paginate` handles ctx cancellation, delay, and progress internally — no manual select needed in the callback

### 4a. Add debug logging

All scrapers must include level-1 debug logging with `scraper.Debugf(1, ...)`. `Paginate` handles page-fetch and total-count logging automatically; add only what it doesn't cover:

```go
// URL mode detection (if your scraper supports multiple URL types):
scraper.Debugf(1, "mysite: scraping model page")

// Worker pool launch (if applicable):
scraper.Debugf(1, "mysite: fetching %d details with %d workers", n, workers)
```

Debug levels by convention: **1** = high-level operations, **2** = HTTP requests (handled by `httpx.Do` automatically), **3** = parsing details.

### 4b. Check for URL filtering modes

Most sites support more than just the main video listing. Check whether the site offers filtered views and add support for each:

- **Model/performer page** (`/model/{slug}`, `/pornstar/{slug}`) — scenes for one performer
- **Channel/series page** (`/channel/{slug}`, `/series/{slug}`) — sub-studio scenes
- **Tag/category page** (`/tag/{slug}`, `/categories/{name}`)

Add each supported URL pattern to `Patterns()` so `fss list-scrapers` shows them. See `kink` (channel/model/tag/series) or `nubiles` (model profile) for examples.

**Pitfall**: model pages often mix videos and galleries — only return video entries.

### 5. Build the Scene

Populate `models.Scene` with as many fields as the site provides. Required fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `ID` | Unique identifier from the site |
| `SiteID` | Your scraper's `ID()` value |
| `StudioURL` | The input studio URL |
| `Title` | Scene title |
| `URL` | Direct link to the scene |
| `ScrapedAt` | `time.Now().UTC()` |

Optional but recommended: `Date`, `Description`, `Thumbnail`, `Preview`, `Performers`, `Tags`, `Categories`, `Duration`, `Width`, `Height`, `Resolution`, `Format`, `Studio`.

For sites with pricing, call `scene.AddPrice()`:

```go
scene.AddPrice(models.PriceSnapshot{
    Date:            now,
    Regular:         19.99,
    Discounted:      9.99,
    IsFree:          false,
    IsOnSale:        true,
    DiscountPercent: 50,
})
```

For free sites (e.g. Pornhub):

```go
scene.AddPrice(models.PriceSnapshot{Date: now, IsFree: true})
```

### 6. Check for an existing platform

Before building a standalone scraper, check [docs/platform-detection.md](docs/platform-detection.md) — your site may belong to an existing `*util` package (Aylo, Gamma, Adult Prime, etc.). If so, you only need a thin wrapper with a site config entry. If no match, build a standalone scraper.

### 7. WordPress sites — use wputil

For WordPress-based sites, the `internal/scrapers/wputil` package provides shared helpers:

- `wputil.BrowserHeaders()` — common browser headers to avoid WAF blocks
- `wputil.FetchSitemap()` / `wputil.FetchAllSitemaps()` — XML sitemap parsing
- `wputil.FetchPage()` — fetch a single page
- `wputil.ParseMeta(body, titleSuffix)` — extract OpenGraph, `article:tag`, `article:published_time`, shortlink post ID, JSON-LD `VideoObject` width/height, and `articleSection` categories
- `wputil.RunWorkerPool()` — sitemap discovery + parallel page fetching with a `PageParser` callback
- `wputil.SlugFromURL()`, `wputil.ParseDuration()`, `wputil.VideoWidth()` — utility helpers

See `taratainton` and `momcomesfirst` for examples. Your scraper only needs to implement the site-specific `parsePage` callback and registration.

### 8. Use the shared HTTP layer

All scrapers should use the shared HTTP client:

```go
import "github.com/Wasylq/FSS/internal/httpx"

// In New():
client: httpx.NewClient(30 * time.Second)

// In fetch methods:
resp, err := httpx.Do(ctx, s.client, httpx.Request{
    URL: pageURL,
    Headers: map[string]string{
        "User-Agent": httpx.UserAgentFirefox,
    },
})
```

This gives you connection pooling, automatic retries with backoff (0s/2s/4s), and fail-fast on non-retryable 4xx errors.

### 9. Write tests

Create `internal/scrapers/<site>/<site>_test.go`. Tests should be offline — use `httptest.NewServer` to serve fixture HTML/JSON responses:

```go
func TestParsing(t *testing.T) {
    ts := httptest.NewServer(http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        w.Write(fixtureHTML)
    }))
    defer ts.Close()
    // test against ts.URL
}
```

What to test:

- URL matching (`MatchesURL` with valid and invalid URLs)
- HTML/JSON parsing (page parsing, edge cases, missing fields)
- Pagination (multi-page responses, empty last page)
- `KnownIDs` early stopping

#### Golden fixtures: pin the wire format, not your own struct

If your scraper decodes JSON, add a **golden fixture** — a response captured from
the live API and committed under `testdata/`.

The reason is specific. A test that builds a production type in Go and encodes it
shares the struct tag on both sides of the round trip:

```go
// Renaming `json:"thumb"` to `json:"thumbnail"` on the struct keeps this GREEN,
// while every live scrape silently loses its thumbnails.
body, _ := json.Marshal(apiScene{Thumb: "https://…"})
```

Only a fixture the API produced can catch that. Rules that have earned their place:

- **Capture verbatim.** Slice raw bytes out of the response; do not re-serialise
  through an encoder. Re-encoding normalises key order, escaping (`\/`, `\u0027`)
  and number formatting — exactly what the fixture exists to detect. Add a
  companion `…IsRawCapture` test asserting a distinctive raw form is still present.
- **Trim by whole keys, never by editing values.** Dropping an unused blob to keep
  the file small is fine (`gammautil` drops Algolia's `_highlightResult`); rewriting
  a retained value is not. Say in the comment what was dropped and why.
- **Check for credentials before committing.** This has bitten repeatedly, in three
  different forms: an AWS presigned URL with `AWSAccessKeyId=AKIA…` in a public
  response (`puremature`), JWTs (`ayloutil`, `visitx`), and CSRF tokens in embedded
  page state (`faphouse`, `legsemporium`). Add a `…CarriesNoToken` test asserting
  the markers are absent, so a future re-capture cannot quietly reintroduce one.
- **Document the shapes the fixture pins.** The value is in what a hand-written
  fixture would have got wrong: numeric-looking strings (`"542"` cents, `"148"`
  seconds), objects where a string is expected (`{"en": …}` titles, `created_at`
  as a struct), two ids side by side (`set_id` vs `set_path`, `_id` vs `id`), and
  Elasticsearch's `{"value":…,"relation":"gte"}` total.
- **Mutation-verify it.** Rename a tag in the production struct and confirm the
  golden test fails while the struct-built tests still pass. If nothing fails, the
  fixture is decorative.

A `*util` fixture covers every wrapper that builds its types — pinning
`mymemberutil.VideosPage` covers `rubberpassion`, `rachelsteele` and `kingnoirexxx`
too, so check for that before adding a redundant one.

#### Offline means offline: sitemap fixtures leak to the live site

Pointing the scraper's base URL at `ts.URL` is **not** enough to make a
sitemap-driven test offline. Sitemap fixtures are captured verbatim, so their
`<loc>` entries are absolute URLs on the real site:

```xml
<loc>https://honeytrans.com/scenes/1310/latina-transsexual-returns-to-toy-ass</loc>
```

A scraper that fetches those URLs as given (`sceneRef{url: u.Loc}`) walks
straight out of the test. Overriding `siteBase` / `s.base` redirects only the
sitemap request; every detail fetch that follows still hits production, the
`httptest` handler never serves `detail.html`, and the assertions grade live
markup instead of the fixture.

Such a test passes on a dev machine and fails on a sandboxed CI runner, on a
page nobody touched. It also means a green run tells you nothing about your
parser. Use `testutil.SitemapServer`, which rewrites the fixture's host to the
test server before serving it:

```go
// Rewrites https://honeytrans.com → the test server; serves the sitemap for
// any "sitemap"-ish path and detail for everything else.
srv := testutil.SitemapServer(t, "https://honeytrans.com",
    readFixture(t, "sitemap.xml"), readFixture(t, "detail.html"))
```

Then assert the fetches stayed local. `scene.URL` is the URL that was actually
requested, so this is a direct check:

```go
if !strings.HasPrefix(sc.URL, srv.URL) {
    t.Errorf("scene %s fetched %q, which is not the test server", sc.ID, sc.URL)
}
```

`SitemapServer` also fails the test if the fixture no longer contains the host
you passed — otherwise a refreshed fixture would silently turn the rewrite into
a no-op and re-enable live fetches. Scrapers that extract only the slug from
`<loc>` and rebuild it against their base (`joybear`, `producersfun`) are not
exposed to this; ones that follow `u.Loc` directly (`arx`, `kristenbjorn`,
`frenchtwinks`, `lustreality`) are.

A quick way to spot the problem in an existing test: an offline `TestListScenes`
should run in ~0.00s. If it takes hundreds of milliseconds, it is talking to
something.

For live integration smoke tests that hit the real site, use the shared `testutil` helper. Each scraper has an `integration_test.go` like:

```go
//go:build integration

package <site>

import (
    "testing"
    "github.com/Wasylq/FSS/internal/scrapers/testutil"
)

// liveStudioURL — pick a stable studio. Update if it 404s.
const liveStudioURL = "https://example.com/profile/123/some-name"

func TestLive<Site>(t *testing.T) {
    testutil.SkipIfPlaceholder(t, liveStudioURL)
    testutil.RunLiveScrape(t, New(), liveStudioURL, 2)
}
```

`testutil.RunLiveScrape` fetches the first 2 scenes, validates each via `testutil.ValidateScene` (non-empty `ID`/`Title`/`URL`/`Date`, plausible `Duration`, etc.), and logs the first scene's full struct so you can eyeball field mappings on `-v`. `SkipIfPlaceholder` skips cleanly when `liveStudioURL` still contains `REPLACE-ME` — use it for new scrapers until you find a stable URL.

Run all of them:

```bash
make smoke              # all scrapers + Stash
make smoke-one SCRAPER=<site>   # one scraper
make smoke-stash        # Stash integration only
```

These are **never run in CI** (Cloudflare blocks shared GitHub-runner IP ranges, and they hit live sites / local services). They're a manual pre-release check.

#### Stash integration tests

The Stash integration tests (`stash/integration_test.go`) verify that the GraphQL client works against your real Stash instance. They are **read-only** — no tags, performers, studios, or scenes are created or modified.

```bash
# Default: connects to http://localhost:9999, no auth
make smoke-stash

# Custom URL and/or API key
FSS_STASH_URL=http://192.168.1.50:9999 make smoke-stash
FSS_STASH_URL=http://192.168.1.50:9999 FSS_STASH_API_KEY=yourkey make smoke-stash
```

If Stash isn't reachable, all tests skip gracefully — no failures.

### 10. Update docs and tracking files

- Add a row to [docs/scrapers.md](docs/scrapers.md) with the site name, URL pattern, platform, and notes.
- Update the site count in `README.md` (auto-verified by `TestReadmeScraperCount` — run `go test ./internal/scrapers/all/...` and it will auto-fix).
- If the new scraper covers a stashdb studio tree, remove the completed entries from all three tracking files:
  - `docs/stashdb-studios.json` — remove entries where the entire tree (parent + all children) is now covered
  - `docs/stashdb-scene-counts.json` — remove the same entries
  - `docs/partially-covered.json` — remove or update completion counts

### 11. Verify

```bash
go build ./...                           # compiles
go vet ./...                             # static analysis
go test -race -count=1 ./...             # all tests pass
go build -o fss . && ./fss list-scrapers # new scraper appears
```

#### Registry-wide checks your scraper must satisfy

Several tests in `internal/scrapers/all` run against **every** registered scraper, so a
new one can fail tests in a package you never touched. What they check, and what a
failure means:

| Test | Requires | Typical fix |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `TestRegistryIDsAreWellFormed` | `ID()` is lowercase `[a-z0-9-]+` and unique | the ID becomes a store filename and a config key — no spaces, dots or capitals |
| `TestRegistryPatternsArePresent` | `Patterns()` non-empty, no blank entries | a blank entry usually means a derivation like `strings.TrimPrefix(base, …)` returned `""` |
| `TestRegistryPatternsAreNotGlued` | a bare-host pattern is not run into a path | you concatenated a path onto `SiteBase` without a leading `/`, giving `example.comtour/…` |
| `TestRegistryMatchesURLIsNotOverBroad` | `MatchesURL` rejects `example.com` and friends | anchor the regex (`^https?://…`) and escape dots (`\.`) |
| `TestScrapersExitOnCancelledContext` | the channel closes on an already-dead context | check `ctx.Err()` before the first fetch |
| `TestScraperSendsAreGuardedByContext` | every `out <-` send is in a `select` with `ctx.Done()` | see [architecture.md](docs/architecture.md#channel-based-streaming) |
| `TestSitesMdInSync` | `docs/sites.md` matches the registry | **it rewrites the file and fails once** — just commit the regenerated `docs/sites.md` |

The over-broad check is the one worth understanding rather than just satisfying:
`scraper.ForURL` returns the **first** registered match, so a loose regex takes over every
scraper after it in registration order. The scrape then appears to work and quietly
produces a different studio's catalogue.

`ForURL` does notice the ambiguity — but it reports it via `Debugf(1, …)`, so nothing is
printed unless the user passes `-d`. If a URL is scraping the wrong site, run
`fss scrape <url> -d` and look for `registry: … also matched by [...]`.

Go's RE2 has no negative lookahead, so where two scrapers legitimately overlap (a network
catch-all and its sub-studios), registration **order** is how the overlap is resolved —
register the specific ones first. `bronetwork` is the worked example: its sub-studios live
at `thebronetwork.com/categories/<slug>`, and until they were registered ahead of the
network catch-all, pasting a sub-studio URL scraped the entire network.

## Cutting a release

Releases are tagged with `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. Pushing the tag triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which builds the cross-platform binaries and `.deb`/`.rpm` packages automatically and then **pauses for manual approval** before publishing.

### Steps

```bash
git tag -a v1.7.0 -m "v1.7.0"
git push origin v1.7.0
```

Then go to the **Actions → Release** run on GitHub, click *Review deployments*, tick `manual-smoke-gate`, and approve. Once the `release` job finishes, two parallel jobs run automatically: `aur` publishes to the AUR (with one retry on transient SSH failure), and `docker` builds and pushes the image to `ghcr.io`. Both sit behind the single approval gate — if either fails you can re-run *just that job* from the Actions UI without re-cutting the GitHub Release.

### What the release produces

| Artifact | Platforms |
|----------|-----------|
| `.tar.gz` binaries | linux/amd64, linux/arm64, darwin/amd64, darwin/arm64 |
| `.zip` binary | windows/amd64 |
| `.deb` package | linux/amd64, linux/arm64 |
| `.rpm` package | linux/amd64, linux/arm64 |
| AUR `fss` package | auto-published after release |
| Docker image (`ghcr.io/wasylq/fss`) | linux/amd64, linux/arm64 |

The `.deb`/`.rpm` packages are built by [nfpm](https://nfpm.goreleaser.com/) using `nfpm.yaml`. To test locally:

```bash
go install github.com/goreleaser/nfpm/v2/cmd/nfpm@latest
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o dist/fss .
GOARCH=amd64 VERSION=1.7.0 nfpm package --packager deb --target dist/
```

### Approver checklist

Before clicking approve, confirm:

- [ ] `make smoke` (scrapers + Stash integration) passed locally — CI cannot run these because Cloudflare blocks shared GitHub runner IP ranges and Stash is a local service.
- [ ] `CHANGELOG`/release notes accurately describe user-visible changes.
- [ ] No known regressions in any of the high-severity checks you track.
- [ ] The new binary's `fss version` shows the expected tag when run locally.

The gate is a **trust-me** check — nothing verifies that you actually ran the smoke tests. Its only job is to force a pause-and-think before a release goes public.

### CI tool version pins

These pins live inside `run:` shell strings (not `go.mod`) so Dependabot can't bump them automatically — review them when you cut a release:

| Tool | Pin | Workflow |
|------|-----|----------|
| `gotestsum` | `v1.13.0` | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (test job) |
| `govulncheck` | `v1.3.0` | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (vulncheck job) |
| `nfpm` | `v2.46.3` | `.github/workflows/release.yml` (build job) |

Bump by editing the `@vX.Y.Z` suffix in each `go install` line. Check the upstream changelog for breaking format changes — `gotestsum` in particular produces the `junit.xml` uploaded to Codecov. (The coverage summary reads `coverage.out` directly, so it is unaffected by `gotestsum`'s output format.)

### CI security checks

`govulncheck` runs on every CI build but is **informational only** — it never fails the pipeline, and there is no release-time gate that fails on findings.

Why: the Go vulnerability database reports findings against the Go toolchain itself (not just third-party deps), so a "fail on any finding" policy would force a Go toolchain bump every time a new Go point release lands — even for low-severity issues that don't affect this codebase. The trade-off is intentional: vulnerabilities surface as workflow warnings, and the maintainer decides when to bump `go.mod` and the runtime.

When triaging a new govulncheck warning:

1. Read the finding in the CI logs (`Vulncheck (informational)` job) — note the GO-YYYY-NNNN ID and which symbol triggers it.
2. If it's a `stdlib` finding, decide whether the call path is actually reachable in this codebase (govulncheck's symbol-level analysis already filters most of these).
3. Bump `go.mod`'s `go` directive and re-run `go mod tidy`. The next workflow run should clear the warning.
4. If you can't bump immediately, link the issue ID in a TODO so a future release can clear it.

### AUR and Homebrew

Packaging files live in `packaging/`:

- `packaging/aur/PKGBUILD` — Arch Linux AUR package. **Automatically published** to the AUR after the GitHub Release is created (via `KSXGitHub/github-actions-deploy-aur` action). Requires `AUR_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` secret in the repository.
- `packaging/homebrew/fss.rb` — Reference Homebrew formula. For a proper tap, create a `homebrew-fss` repository and publish the formula there after each release.

Both AUR and Homebrew support system-level updates (`yay -Syu` / `brew upgrade`). For `.deb`/`.rpm` auto-updates via `apt upgrade`/`dnf upgrade`, a hosted package repository (e.g. Packagecloud, Cloudsmith, or Gemfury) is needed — see `docs/enhancements.md`.

### One-time setup (per maintainer / per fork)

The `manual-smoke-gate` environment must exist in the GitHub repository before the workflow can pause on it. To create it:

1. Repository → **Settings → Environments → New environment**, name it `manual-smoke-gate`.
2. Under **Deployment protection rules**, tick *Required reviewers* and add yourself (and any co-maintainers).
3. Save. No environment secrets are needed.

Without this, the release workflow will fail with `Environment "manual-smoke-gate" not found` on the first tag push. Environment protection rules with required reviewers are free for public repositories.
