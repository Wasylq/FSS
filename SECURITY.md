# Security Policy

## Credentials

FSS handles credentials in two places:

- **Stash API key** — authenticates against your Stash instance
- **Site API keys** — some scrapers extract rotating API keys from site HTML at runtime (e.g., Algolia keys for Gamma Entertainment sites)

### Best practices

- Use the `FSS_STASH_API_KEY` environment variable instead of putting your API key in `config.yaml`. Config files on disk are readable by any process running as your user.
- Never commit `config.yaml` to version control. The `.gitignore` does not cover it since it lives outside the repo (XDG config directory), but be careful if you copy it into the project.
- Site API keys extracted at runtime are ephemeral and not stored.

## User-Agent

FSS defaults to a Firefox user-agent string. You can override it in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
user_agent: "chrome"              # use the built-in Chrome UA
user_agent: "MyBot/1.0"           # use a custom string
user_agent: ""                    # default: Firefox UA
```

The UA string is sent with every HTTP request to scraper target sites. It does not affect requests to your Stash instance.

## Network

FSS makes outbound HTTP requests to:

- Scraper target sites (the studio URLs you provide)
- Algolia's API (`TSMKFA364Q-dsn.algolia.net`) for Gamma Entertainment scrapers
- Your Stash instance (default `localhost:9999`)

No data is sent to any analytics services, or any other third party.

### SSRF mitigations

Two commands fetch image URLs that came from scraped metadata: `fss stash import --cover` (pushes the image to Stash) and `fss identify --poster` (saves it beside the video). When the metadata is a third-party JSON dump, a malicious URL could target internal services. Both go through one validator before fetching:

- **Scheme**: only `http` and `https` are allowed. `file://`, `gopher://`, `data:`, etc. are rejected.
- **Host**: must not resolve to a private (RFC1918), loopback, link-local, or unspecified IP address. This blocks `localhost`, cloud metadata endpoints (`169.254.169.254`), and internal network hosts.
- **Size**: response bodies are capped at 10 MiB.

If your images are hosted on a LAN media server (e.g. `192.168.1.50`), pass `--cover-allow-private` (import) or `--poster-allow-private` (identify) to bypass the IP check. The scheme and size restrictions still apply.

Both are off by default, and no image is fetched unless you ask for it — neither `--cover` nor `--poster` is enabled implicitly.

The implementation is `internal/mediafetch`: `ValidateURL` enforces the scheme and address rules, `Fetch` applies the size cap. `stash.DownloadCoverImage` and `identify`'s poster download both call it, so there is no second, unvalidated fetch path. See [docs/stash.md — Cover image fetching](docs/stash.md#cover-image-fetching) and [docs/identify.md — Posters](docs/identify.md#posters-and-expiring-thumbnails).

**Limitation**: the DNS lookup happens before the HTTP request. DNS rebinding attacks (where a hostname resolves to a public IP during validation but to a private IP during the actual fetch) are not mitigated. For the expected threat model — importing someone else's JSON dump — the attacker would also need to control DNS for a domain the user resolves, which is a low-probability scenario.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you find a security issue, please open a GitHub issue or email the maintainer directly. There is no bug bounty program.
